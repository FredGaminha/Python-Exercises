# Python-Exercises

This is a small package of mini-projects for beginners using the ***Python*** language.
Feel free to preview the mini-projects and make your own studies or changes.

## 1st Mini-Project - Number Guessing Game

The first project is the creation of a mini-game in which the user needs to guess the number previously selected by the system.

The game gives you ten attempts to guess the right number with two hints to help you discover the number based on the remaining attempts.

Two functions *(functions)* were created, the first *function* for the game logic in guessing the number and the second *function* for the control of attempts and hints. As well, the **random** library was used to use the randomness functionality for the machine and also to help the user during the 2nd tip.

## 2nd Mini-Project - Jokenpô

The second project is the creation of a mini-game in which the user needs to win against the system, through a game of Jokenpô (Rock, Paper Scissors).

The game will give you three options to choose from to confront against the machine. The game will signal when there is a draw or victory / defeat.

It will be revealed which option is selected by the machine as a form of guidance in matches resulting in defeat.


## 3rd Mini-Project - Stopwatch

The 3rd project is the creation of a timer in which the user will enter a time (in seconds) and the system will convert it into minutes and seconds and will start to reduce the time every second, as if it were a clock.

The **time** library was used to create this mini-project.

## 4th Mini-Project - Password Generator
This 4th project, it provides a password generator based on two variables that can be declared by the user.

The first variable, is how much password you want the system to generate and the second variable, is about the length for each password.

There's only one rule... The length of the password needs to be **higher or equal to 8** and **lower or equal to 32** characters, more or less than two condition will cause an error.

## 5th Mini-Project - QR Code Generator

This 5th mini-project, it allows the user to generate a QR Code from a link or text to be scanned by a smartphone.

There's three variables inside the program.

| Variable | Description |
| :------: | :---------- |
| userPhrase | User's Text or URL that will be revealed by the QR Code Reader app. |
| userFile | File name the archive will be stored on your phone/computer |
| qrFile   | File format will be exported, can choose between **.png, .svg** and **.pdf** |

## 6th Mini-Project - Saving-Password

This is my 6th mini-project, it opens a GUI allowing to save a password of your choice and that password will be recorded into a password.txt file.

## 7th Mini-Project - Contact Book

This is my 7th mini-project, will create a database using **SQLite 3** library and allows the user to insert new contacts, view all contacts, delete contact or update info about one contact.

## 8th Mini-Project - CPF Digit

This is my 8th mini-project, this one, will generate the lasts 2 digits to CPF and this new CPF will be valid, if you validate in a website.

You can validate on https://4devs.com/validador_cpf/
