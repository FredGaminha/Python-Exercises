# Python-Exercises

This is a small package of mini-projects for beginners using the ***Python*** language.
Feel free to preview the mini-projects and make your own studies or changes.

## 1st Mini-Project - Number Guessing Game

The first project is the creation of a mini-game in which the user needs to guess the number previously selected by the system.

The game gives you ten attempts to guess the right number with two hints to help you discover the number based on the remaining attempts.

Two functions *(functions)* were created, the first *function* for the game logic in guessing the number and the second *function* for the control of attempts and hints. As well, the **random** library was used to use the randomness functionality for the machine and also to help the user during the 2nd tip.

## 2nd Mini-Project - Jokenpô

The second project is the creation of a mini-game in which the user needs to win against the system, through a game of Jokenpô (Rock, Paper Scissors).

The game will give you three options to choose from to confront against the machine. The game will signal when there is a draw or victory / defeat.

It will be revealed which option is selected by the machine as a form of guidance in matches resulting in defeat.


## 3rd Mini-Project - Stopwatch

The last project is the creation of a timer in which the user will enter a time (in seconds) and the system will convert it into minutes and seconds and will start to reduce the time every second, as if it were a clock.

The **time** library was used to create this mini-project.
